# Subscription Flow

## Minimalistic Subscription Flow

Thank you for checking out the repo of my minimalistic Subscription Flow project.
It was a very exciting 5-days challenge where I could practice and improve my knowledge of React.

Here are some to better illustrate some of its pages:

## Getting started

To run this project you will need a React version 16.8 or above.
I also used [parcel bundler](https://parceljs.org/) for compiling the data.
After cloning this repo, open the file on your terminal and follow the instructions bellow:

1. npm install
2. npm start
3. Use the http://localhost in your browser as showed bellow:

## What I used

The power of React components allowed me to use some structures from previous projects. I also leveraged external libraries, which helped me to quickly prototype the core features like building the main pages, rendering data from my forms, etc.
Check out the list:

React context

- HTML
- SCSS
  - postcssrc
- React.js
  - [Router](https://reactrouter.com/)
  - [hook-forms](https://react-hook-form.com/)
  - [icons](https://react-icons.github.io/react-icons/)
  - [spinners](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-spinners)
  - [toastify](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-toastify)

## Future improvements

For this project, I still want to implement:

- Typescript for easy alerts of mistakes, improve readability and efficiency of development;
- Tests
- Revisit UX and Designs issues (in case I could talk to a designer about it)
